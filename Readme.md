## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **APS Account**: Retrieve your app's `client_id` and `client_secret` from the [Developer Portal](https://aps.autodesk.com/myapps). 
2. **Node.js**: basic knowledge with [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. **JavaScript** basic knowledge. 
4. **Maya** (optional) to view/edit the Bifrost graph being executed


### Setup

Download & install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Install the required packages using `npm install`.

Set the following environment variable with your APS app client id and secret

```
APS_CLIENT_ID={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}
APS_CLIENT_SECRET={YOUR_CLIENT_SCRET}
```

### Running

By default, this Flow Graph Engine `Job` sample execute [this bifrost graph file](./input-data/addTrees.json) with the following inputs:

- [a usd file](./input-data/plane.usd) in which the first mesh prim will be used to scatter on
- An amount of trees to scatter.  Set to 1000 in the code.
- A usd output file name where to write the output scattered trees

To execute the code, run `node index.js`
